1.       Can you provide more information on the missing data e.g. for each variable show the % missing
- Done - table and heatmap in supplement


2.       What does a simple comparison of the 2 survival outcomes show?
- median f/u, median survival, 5yr os/rfs unchanged - just slightly narrower confidence intervals
- for the cox ph models, there are changes in the magnitude of the parameters, but no change in those that are significant, and no real influence on the treatment parameter

- There were differences in the univariate outcomes which are included in the published manuscript


3.       It wasnâ€™t clear why you needed to include recurrent events? Is this for patients who had separate recurrences after separate surgeries?

- Yeah, this turned out to be a big pain in the ass for nothing to be honest. For overall survival, I just did plain KM and Cox PH. A subset of patients had liver recurrences and repeated surgery, most had 2 operations, and a few had 3 or 4. The number of patients having 3 or 4 ended up being too few to be meaningful, so I condensed it down to two different strata - 1 operation or 2+ operations and produced a gaptime model looking at rate of recurrence ofter each operation. The idea was to see if you recurred quicker after you've already had a previous recurrence. There is a trend (33 months to recurence after 1 op, 24 after 2+) but the numbers are still too low to be meaningful.

Does this sound reasonable?


4.       Given you say that initially the simple cases are used for laparoscopic surgery, would it be useful to split the data into 2 time periods (e.g. 2000-2007; 2008-2014) and estimate HRs for each time period?

Or alternatively conduct sensitivity analysis using the prospective data only (2004-2014) to estimate the HRs. This would hopefully eliminate bias due to retrospective data collection and minimise selection bias due to initially tending to include the simpler cases for laparoscopic surgery.

- Will go down the sensitivy analysis route I think. The numbers pre-2004 are low compared to after, so I think the pre-2004 estimates will be be quite broad.
